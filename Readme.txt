Description

This series of folders and files relates to a research project examining the temporal demand for bikeshare in London. The project investigated the links between demand and a set of environmental conditions covering weather patterns and air quality levels. 

The project has been built in the R programming language (https://www.r-project.org/) and relies on a number of packages to conduct the statistical analysis. These packages will need to be installed to run the analysis, with the list of applicable packages presented at the top of each code book.

The analysis has been published in the Journal of Transport Geography and can be viewed at the following URL:

The folders contain the following resources which will allow for the replication of the analysis presented in the paper. 

Data: contains spreadsheets of the data utilised in the analysis, with the "Int_missing_dif_ma_lag.csv" being the most important one

Code: contains the R scripts utilised to perform the analysis

Paper: contains a version of the paper describing the results of the analysis

In order to conduct the walkthrough, follow these steps

[1] Load the project file "LondonBikes.Rproj" located in the LBSS_Temporal folder into RStudio
[2] Import the dataset 'Int_missing_dif_ma_lag.csv'
[3] start to run the code, I suggest line-by-line
